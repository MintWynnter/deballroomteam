Home Page:
	Home page should be very short. Everything should fit in one screen. Have a navbar at the top of the screen with links to the "About," "Schedule," "Announcements," and "Donations" pages.
	Maybe have some pictures, but not too many.
	
About Page:
	Brief description of the team, as well as how we teach/what we dance. We can have more pictures here, if we want. We can also have contact info here, or in a different page, if desired.

Scedule Page:
	Should be self explanatory. This will have the schedule for the lessons.
	
Announcements Page:
	This is where any announcements about upcoming lessons or cancellations will go.
	
Donations Page:
	Here we can link to the gofundme, and have a brief explanation of what the money will go towards.
	
(possibility) Performance Request Page:
	We could have a page that gives a way for people to request us for performances at events, private lessons, or other things. This could probably also go into the contacts page.
